🚀 Project Overview  
The 21-Days SQL Challenge is a guided, hands-on programme that takes learners from SQL fundamentals to advanced query patterns used in real-world analytics and engineering. Over 21 days you'll practice SELECTs, filters, joins, aggregations, window functions, CTEs, query optimisation and more — using a curated Hospital Beds Management dataset (modified for the challenge).

Who is this for?  
Beginners who want to build practical SQL skills for roles in Data Analysis, Data Engineering, Data Science, AI or Software Development.

Goal:   
By the end of the challenge you will be comfortable writing production-grade SQL queries, organising complex analytics with CTEs and window functions, and presenting insights.
